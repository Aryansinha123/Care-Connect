# 🕊️ CareConnect

CareConnect is a professional, high-fidelity platform designed to bridge the gap between generous donors, passionate volunteers, and verified shelter homes (orphanages and old-age homes). Built using **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MongoDB**, it provides role-based workspaces for donors, shelter admins, and super admins to facilitate secure monetary donations (via Razorpay and direct UPI), item contributions, and volunteering event coordination.

## 👥 Roles & System Workflows

CareConnect operates on a strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism. Below are the workflows and interface capabilities for each user type:

### 1. Standard User (Donor / Volunteer)
The standard user experience centers on discovery, donation, and volunteer engagement.

#### 🔄 User Flow:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Visit Homepage] --> B{Logged In?}
    B -- No --> C[Register / Login via Credentials or Google OAuth]
    B -- Yes --> D[Search & Browse Verified Homes]
    D --> E[View Home Profile Page]
    E --> F{Select Action}
    F -->|Donate Money| G[Pay via Razorpay / Scan UPI QR]
    F -->|Donate Items| H[Fill Donation Details & Pickup Address]
    F -->|Volunteer| I[Apply for Event / Volunteer Slot]
    G & H & I --> J[Track Contribution Status in My History]
```

#### 🖥️ Interface Details & Features:
*   **Search and Discovery Panel:** A search engine allowing donors to filter verified homes by Name, Location, or Type (`orphanage` vs `oldage`).
*   **Shelter Profiles (`/homes/[id]`):** Details the shelter's mission, location, current requirements, and contact channels.
*   **Flexible Donations:**
    *   **Monetary:** Standardized integration with Razorpay checkout and a UPI modal displaying the shelter's custom VPA QR code (supporting mobile deep links).
    *   **In-Kind/Items:** Allows users to donate items (e.g. food, clothing, books) by specifying categories, quantity, and a physical pickup address.
*   **Volunteer Portal:** Lists event listings published by shelters, letting users join with a single click.
*   **Announcements HUD:** Features site-wide popups from Super Admins and specific shelter updates from Home Admins. Uses localized dismissal tracking (`localStorage` or database logs) to prevent repetitive popups.
*   **Personal Ledger (`/user/history`):** A history log detailing monetary donation statuses, item pickup progress (Pending, Accepted, Completed), and registered volunteering events.

### 2. Orphanage/OldAgeHome Admin (Home Admin)
Home Admins oversee shelter operations, manage user donations, and schedule targeted alerts for their specific shelter.

#### 🔄 User Flow:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Submit Shelter Application /register-home] --> B[Super Admin Verification]
    B -- Approved --> C[Receive Login Credentials]
    C --> D[Login via /home-admin/login]
    D --> E[Access Home Admin Dashboard]
    E --> F{Manage Requests & Notices}
    F -->|Create Need| G[Publish Item Request / Volunteer Request]
    F -->|Audit| H[Approve/Complete User Item Donations & Review Volunteers]
    F -->|Announce| I[Publish Scheduled Notices on Shelter Page]
```

#### 🖥️ Interface Details & Features:
*   **Digital Onboarding (`/register-home`):** Enables new shelters to apply by providing administrative credentials, official documentation URLs, UPI virtual payment addresses (VPA), and base64-encoded QR code images.
*   **Management Dashboard (`/home-admin/dashboard`):**
    *   **Need Publisher:** Form endpoints to post item donation requests (specifying category, name, and amount) and volunteer events (specifying datetime, location, and volunteer headcount).
    *   **Received Item Ledger:** Tracks user donations. Admins can update status states (`Pending` ➡️ `Accepted` ➡️ `Completed`).
    *   **Volunteers Registry:** Displays lists of registered volunteers for scheduled events.
*   **Shelter Notices Panel (`/admin/homes/[id]/notices`):**
    *   Lets admins schedule notices (with HTML content formatting) with `startAt` and `endAt` dates.
    *   Configure notices with priority status (`high`, `medium`, `low`) and `showOnce` dismissible alerts.

---

### 3. Super Admin
Super Admins act as the compliance and oversight body, managing system configuration and approving new shelter listings.

#### 🔄 User Flow:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Access Secure Portal /admin/login] --> B[Enter Super Admin Credentials]
    B --> C[Access Super Admin Control Center]
    C --> D{Perform Audits & Site Administration}
    D -->|Review Submissions| E[Approve/Reject Pending Shelter Requests]
    D -->|Users & Shells| F[Manage Registered Homes & Assigned Home Admins]
    D -->|Global Alerts| G[Publish Site-Wide Notice Popups]
    D -->|Scale Ops| H[Provision Additional System Admins]
```

#### 🖥️ Interface Details & Features:
*   **Administrative Access (`/admin/login`):** An isolated, secure login page for authorized administrative staff.
*   **Control Center (`/admin/dashboard`):** Displays platform analytics (total users, verified shelters, ongoing donation cycles, and global metrics).
*   **Verification Queue (`/admin/home-requests`):** Review pending onboarding registrations. Approving creates the shelter entry and corresponding `HomeAdmin` user credentials.
*   **Directory Management:**
    *   **Shelters Registry (`/admin/homes`):** Direct update/edit controls for all registered shelter entries.
    *   **Admins Registry (`/admin/homeadminsList`):** Manage administrative users linked to individual shelters.
*   **Site-Wide Notice Manager (`/admin/notices`):** Publish priority notices across all system views. Supports custom duration, enabling/disabling, priority-based coloring, and frequency constraints (`one_time` seen checks or `every_visit`).

## 🗄️ Database Schema Relationships

CareConnect uses Mongoose models to handle data relationships:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ Donation : "makes item donations"
    User ||--o{ Payment : "makes monetary payments"
    User ||--o{ VolunteerParticipation : "registers for events"
    User ||--o{ NoticeSeen : "tracks read status"
    
    Home ||--o{ Request : "publishes item needs"
    Home ||--o{ VolunteerRequest : "publishes volunteer events"
    Home ||--o{ HomeNotice : "publishes alerts"
    Home ||--|| HomeAdmin : "managed by"
    
    HomeRequest ||--o| Home : "approved creates"
    
    VolunteerRequest ||--o{ VolunteerParticipation : "contains"
    HomeNotice ||--o{ NoticeDismissal : "tracks dismissals"
```

### Schemas Summary:
1.  **`User`**: Supports password login and Google OAuth.
2.  **`Home`**: Contains shelter type, description, and payment details (base64 QR / UPI VPA).
3.  **`HomeAdmin`**: Linked to a specific `Home` document to allow workspace management.
4.  **`HomeRequest`**: An onboarding application containing document uploads and contact info.
5.  **`Donation`**: Represents physical item offerings (food, clothing, books) containing pickup details and status.
6.  **`Payment`**: Logs monetary donations via Razorpay parameters.
7.  **`Request`**: Item requests published by shelters.
8.  **`VolunteerRequest`**: Scheduled events published by shelters.
9.  **`VolunteerParticipation`**: Many-to-many table linking `User` and `VolunteerRequest` with a unique index to prevent duplicate sign-ups.
10. **`Notice` & `NoticeSeen`**: Site-wide announcements and their read status logs.
11. **`HomeNotice` & `NoticeDismissal`**: Shelter-specific alerts and their dismissal logs.
