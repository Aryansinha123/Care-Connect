so i want three interfaces basically 
1-for the donator/user which we already have
2-super admin of platform which manage crud for home
3-a dedicated admin for the home having functionality like raising a special request
and receiving donations a dedicated page for seeing history of the donation received

so lets start with the home admin implementation --homeAdmin
create a seperate schema for this admin and assign a particular home and also on clicking donate now button it should redirect to dedicated page for that home where it shows featured request made my homeAdmin on left and main content on right







leave this i am thinking of a different flow
so a dedicated login page for home-admin where he enter name or email along with the password and he is redirected to his dashboard where the details of admin is displayed along with the home details associated with the admin and also a request creation functionality should be implemeneted 
give me detailed instructions and explaination keeping the things we have done so far in check so everything remain consistent
